Test,Purpose,Summary
Test 1,test_functionality_testing,This test will check if the number of objects sensed and post meged are equal or not
Test 2,test_numberof_objects,This test check if the expected number of items were detected
Test 3,test_with_one_empty_sensor,Check If the output is as expected when one sensor is a defect
Test 4,test_few_sensor_input,Test if the sensor cannot detect all the objects because of imroper visibility
Test 5,test_no_input_from_sensor,Check when there is not input from sensors
Test 6,Probability check,The test verifies if the probability limit is between 0 and 100
Test 7,Probability check,The test verifies the integrity of merger algorithm when probability above 100 is given
