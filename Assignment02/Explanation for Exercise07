2) As the value of the k increases the function value increases because of the value being used while calculating value of I being greater.

3) The Effeciency of the code can be defined based on the time it takes and How complex the code

    Time complexity is defined in the form of BigO notation. So as per the code written the time complexity is O(n) because of for loop written.
